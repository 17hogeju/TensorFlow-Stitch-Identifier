The Stitch Identifier is a program that uses machine learning to identify types of stitches in knit patterns. A user can upload an image using the provided interface and the Stitch Identifier will output the result of what pattern the sample image most closely resembles. The patterns that are currentlly supported must be in a swatch and must consist of either knit and purl stitches.
